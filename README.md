# üöÄ My AI Learning Journey  

This repository documents my **self-learning** journey in Artificial Intelligence, following the [AI Engineer Roadmap (2024)](https://codebasics.io/resources/ai-engineer-roadmap-2024) by CodeBasics. While I have an academic background in AI, this initiative goes beyond formal studies, focusing on **practical, hands-on learning** from fundamental programming to advanced deep learning concepts.  

## üìå Learning Roadmap  

I've followed a structured path, starting from scratch and progressively diving into key AI domains:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Python & Programming Foundations**  
- Python basics (syntax, data structures, OOP)  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Science & Machine Learning**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Supervised & Unsupervised Learning  
- Feature Engineering and Model Evaluation  
- Scikit-Learn for ML models  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Deep Learning & Neural Networks**  
- TensorFlow & PyTorch fundamentals  
- CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers  
- Model optimization and fine-tuning  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **MLOps & Deployment**  
- Model serving with FastAPI  
- CI/CD pipelines for AI models  
- Cloud & Edge AI deployment
